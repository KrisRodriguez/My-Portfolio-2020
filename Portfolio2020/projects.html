      As a self taught developer, i have to find projects to build my
      experience. Below you'll find some websites i built as a volunteer for a
      local Tech group as well as one i built for a church directly. Further
      below you will find some small applications i built from challenge
      projects.

            This was a learner project, it was the first site i built without
            using tutorials, but solely referred to my notes. I had to use
            HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript as well as OOP and form validation. I also
            included the coding projects ive done in this portfolio. I'm hoping
            this will get me my start in an actual Junior Dev position.

            This was the first project i built which brought me into
            programming. My local church pastor asked if i could build him a new
            site for the church. The whole project was based on the pastors
            focus and approval. We met weekly so he could give me his ideas and
            wants for design and layout.

            This was a part of a volunteer project for a local tech group named
            Empower Waco. It was a group of volunteers getting together to help
            churches build an online presence to help through these times. This
            project was a WordPress build with custom configuration and theme
            changes, as well as useful techs like Slack and Trello for team
            working. The team built 2 Websites, both are listed here.
